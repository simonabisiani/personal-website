I am a <b>computational journalism Doctoral Researcher</b> at the newly founded <b>Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</b>. My PhD focuses on measuring <b>spatial variations in news coverage in the UK</b> to understand the robustness of local media coverage across the country, and how ownership consolidation affects media diversity and relevance - and whether media diversity and relevance affect democratic engagement. My primary research methods are <b>text mining (including ML), and causal inference</b>.

I became fascinated in data journalism during my BA in Scotland, while trying to map social inequalities using census data. The desire to harness the power of data and better grasp the responsibilities coming with it got me to pursue a MSc in Computational Social Science, where I delved in the theory and practice of social network analysis, agent-based modelling, dimensionality reduction methods, and web scraping.

I have also worked as a <b>data journalist</b> at <a href="www.sheldon.studio">Sheldon.studio</a> and at <a href="www.datajournalism.com">DataJournalism.com</a>. At DataJournalism.com, I have created, analysed, visualised, and digitally presented <b>the State of Data Journalism 2021, 2022, and 2023</b> surveys. At Sheldon.studio, I was the principal data analyst, chart chooser, and content writer for <a href="https://disableddata.fightthestroke.org/">Disabled Data</a>, a project that shed light on the difficulties surrounding availability of data on people with disabilities in Italy, and on <a href = "https://data.europa.eu/apps/eusanctionstracker/">The Sanction Tracker</a> for <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en">data.europa.eu</a>.
