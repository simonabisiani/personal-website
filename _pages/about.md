I am a <b>computational journalism Doctoral Researcher</b> at the newly founded <b>Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</b>. I became fascinated in data journalism during my BA in Scotland, while trying to map social inequalities using census data. The desire to harness the power of data and better grasp the responsibilities coming with it got me to pursue a MSc in Computational Social Science, where I delved in the theory and practice of social network analysis, agent-based modelling, dimensionality reduction methods, and web scraping.

Before my PhD I worked as a <b>data journalist</b> at <a href="www.sheldon.studio">Sheldon.studio</a> and at <a href="www.datajournalism.com">DataJournalism.com</a>. At DataJournalism.com, I have created, analysed, visualised, and digitally presented <b>the State of Data Journalism 2021 and 2022</b> surveys. At Sheldon.studio, I have worked on <a href="https://disableddata.fightthestroke.org/">Disabled Data</a>, a project that shed light on the difficulties surrounding availability of data on people with disabilities in Italy, and an <b>upcoming project on sanctions</b> for <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en">data.europa.eu</a>.

Since 2019 I have been <b>programming in R</b>, and now I use Python as well. My PhD focuses on measuring <b>spatial variations in news coverage in the UK</b>. The newly emerging literature on news deserts has this far focused on measuring spatial variations in news supply based on office locations and number of titles available per geographic entity. It lacks, to this day, the <b>study of content to capture news deserts</b>, or the <b>study of geographical dispersion of user engagement with local news on social media</b>. In my research, I use <b>machine learning and text mining</b> to tackle these challenges.

As a computational journalist, I:
-  avail of data processing techniques to generate journalistic outputs that strive for objectivity and truth, which I promote through methodological transparency
-  use digital traces on social networks to better understand human behaviour
-  use computational tools to make better sense of the directions newsrooms should take in our digital age 

<br>
Polarization, loss of trust in news organizations, the development of algorithmic journalism, content virality, abundance of information, and shrinking spans of collective attention, are some of the big challenges and opportunities journalism in the twenty-first century is facing, and the industry requires individuals capable of making sense of these complex phenomena. Journalism, data science, and computational social science will increasingly go hand in hand, and I intend to be at the intersection of these fields.
