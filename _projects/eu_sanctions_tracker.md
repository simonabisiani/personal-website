Data.europa.eu hired Sheldon.studio, where at the time I was working as data reporter, to create a Sanctions Tracker, or in other words a dashboard enabling people within and outside the organisation to quickly, simply, and smartly keep track of sanctions promulgated by the EU.

My tasks included:
-   understand the data and what to do with it: how is the data organised, which variables are useful, and what can we do with them?
-   coordinate with our developers and designers: decide which data to extract, how to visualise it, and how to implement logic (UX) on the webpage.
-   create textual content for the website and the visualisations
