In this project, which I carried out while doing an internship at the European Journalism Centre in Maastricht, The Netherlands, I have been in charge of a global survey aimed at the data journalism industry, designed and delivered for the <a href="https://ejc.net/">European Journalism Centre</a>â€™s <a href="https://datajournalism.com/">DataJournalism.com</a>. The project ended up constituting the largest survey of data journalists worldwide, with over 1500 respondents. 
<br>
My tasks included:
-   create the survey and spread it
-   analyse the results
-   visualise the results
-   create <a href="https://datajournalism.com/survey/2021/">a website</a> where to present the visual results
-   write textual content to accompany the visuals
-   <a href= "https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2021">release an open version of the dataset</a>
