Data about people with disability in Italy is hard to find, sometimes scattered across different websites, often discontinued, hard to interpret, and badly visualised. While carrying out an internship at Sheldon.studio in Bolzano, Italy, I worked on a project for Fightthestroke.org, in which we pulled together data about people with disabilities, explained the context, and made it visually and interactively accessible to all. 

My tasks included:
-   research the problem: what data exists, and where is it stored?
-   coordinate between the data extractors (the fantastic Andrea Borruso at onData) and our developers: decide which data to extract, how to visualise it
-   prepare text for the website and the visualisations
