The following page presents what, to the best of my knowledge, are current local news titles in existence in March 2023 in the United Kingdom.

The primary goal of this site to offer a current understanding of news deserts based on geographic district of coverage. The location associated to each news titles relates to office location or the title of the digital or print paper/site. This location has been associated to one, and sometimes several, Local Authority Districts, which are official administrative boundaries provided by the Office for National Statistics. The Local Authority Districts are continuously updates, and the ones used here are the ones released in December 2022. 

Looking at presence of titles within Local Authority Districts, by means of office location or title supposed area of coverage, is by no means the only way to map news deserts, and my work at University of Surrey focuses on tackling other ways to measure them. For example, one can look at circulation of titles, tackling the consumption aspect of the news ecosystem. Another way to assess consumption is to look at news media engagement, and that is something I will be doing in my PhD. But what to me, and many more of those who are in this field, is perhaps the most challenging, puzzling, and interesting aspect is that of news content: what is the actual area of coverage of a news title, based on its content? Is news content provided by local titles actually relevant to their local audiences? My PhD focuses on explaining news deserts when looking at news content: who is talked about in the news, and who is not? Which local communities are neglected? Do neglected communities bear resemblance, by means of deomographic profiles and economic activity, or local media history?

One key component of studying local news deserts is to define the local in local news, something that is far by having consensus in the literature. But, for the purpose of this page, local news are titles whose primary scope is a local community. 

To collect these titles, I used information from several public resources, and an extensive methodology on the data collection can be found in a dedicated book project on this part of my research.
