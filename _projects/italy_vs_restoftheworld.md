Head here to read this post in -> <b><a href="#italian">Italiano</a></b>

For the second year in a row, I have been in charge of a global survey aimed at the data journalism industry, designed and delivered for the <a href="https://ejc.net/">European Journalism Centre</a>’s <a href="https://datajournalism.com/">DataJournalism.com</a>. In this post I build on that analysis to expose the characteristics of one particular subgroup of respondents: those who work as data journalists in Italy. 

The principal questions are: what are the characteristics of the data journalism industry in Italy, and how do they differ from the rest of the world? 

While the results from the entire survey are available on Datajournalism.com's dedicated <a href="https://datajournalism.com/survey/2022/"> website</a>, the following charts offer an unparalleled dive into Italy's workforce of "giornalisti di dati".

&nbsp; 

Here is what we are going to explore:
-   demographics
-   employment
-   skills and tools
-   work practices
-   challenges
-   russia-ukraine coverage
-   pandemic

Oh, and a reminder! The analysis can be replicated through this <a href= "https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2022">release of an open version of the dataset</a>

&nbsp; 
<h2>Tl;dr</h2>

In Italy, when it comes do data journalism:
-   there are relatively more women compared to the rest of the world, who are also more highly educated, particularly compared to their male counterparts; people tend to be older;
-   there are relatively many more freelancers and less editors or educators; no women cover editorial positions; young people (under 24) are solely students, unlike elsewhere;
-   there is less reliance on higher education or workplace training as a means to learn the profession, and online courses fill that gap (or create it);
-   the gender pay gap is even more strongly marked than in the rest of the world; there are fewer people earning less, but when this happens, these tend to be women;
-   there is a tendency to not be involved in investigative journalism as in the rest of the world. Instead people are more focused on web designing, using languages such as HTML/CSS, and creating stories enriched by data. This lack of prioritisation of investigative reporting compared to the rest of the world shows up again when looking at perceived values and challenges of data journalism;
-   people in the industry have been relatively less personally affected by the pandemic, and people see the pandemic as having had a mostly positive effect on data journalism; nearly half of respondents have become a data journalist as a result of the pandemic;
-   the industry's struggles are relatively more focused around correct data usage rather than financial limitations or time pressure;
-   more people tend to cover the environment, whereas elsewhere the top category is politics. There are relatively (and also in absolute terms) more people working for international outlets than national ones. The print press, in newspaper or magazine format, is much more common as a publishing medium than in the rest of the world;
-   there are relatively less collaborations, less dedicated data units, and relatively more stories were delivered within a day, despite longer deadlines being the norm in Italy too;
-   relatively more reporters did on-the-ground coverage of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

<h2>Demographics</h2>
<br>
More women than the average and generally older: that's the picture portrayed by the Italian demographics in The State of Data Journalism Survey 2022. 

The age pattern between Italians and the rest of the world is noticeably different: while 38% in the world are over 45, in Italy the same group is 58%. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13012778"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In education, women tend to be more highly educated than men, and this is something that we see both in Italy and in the rest of the world. Further than that, Italians in data journalism tend to be more highly educated than people in data journalism across the world, with more people obtaining Master's degrees. However, when it comes to PhDs the picture is slightly different: while 14% of women in Italy have a PhD, only 5% of men do. This is against 11% and 12% in the rest of the world, thus highlihting a gap that is not found in the rest of the globe. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13013014"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In terms of discipline, data journalists in Italy are less likely to pursue degrees in the humanities than their counterparts (54% to 42%), and instead more likely than their counterparts to have degrees in the social, formal, and natural sciences, as well as in areas not covered by the option list. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<br>

<h2>Employment</h2>
<br>

<b>Occupation</b>

Italy is a country of freelancers. While in the rest of the world the top two occupations in data journalism are full-time employments at a news organisation (31%) and research/education based positions (15%), in Italy freelancers account for 35% of all occupation types (against 22% in the rest of the world).

In Italy, however, there are less people covering editorial positions or jobs in research and education. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025227"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

By gender, we understand a little bit more about these discrepancies. Remember all these freelancers Italy has? Well, full-time freelancers tend to be men, and part-time freelancers tend to be women. Furthermore, virtually no woman in Italy that has taken the survey covers an editorial position in data journalism. Men overrepresent research/education positions too (5% of men against 3% of women). A higher share of students in Italy tend to be women (10% of women, against 6% of men).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025376"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<br>

And what about age? When do different roles get picked up by workers? The patterns looks strikingly different between Italy and the rest of the world. First of all, if you are under 24 in Italy you are most likely (100% in our dataset) a student. This is truly not the case elsewhere, as only 39% of under 24 in the rest of the world are students. Another noticeable difference is that research positions elsewhere linearly increase with age, while in Italy they are scattered across age groups. On the contrary, while editorial roles in the world are evenly distributed across ages, in Italy it is a privilege for the eldest. While employment contracts tend to be more common among young people between 18-44 years of age, in Italy they are again scattered across age groups. And finally, a significant difference is in the number of people who felt the answer options did not represent them: nearly 40% in the 45-54 age group in Italy, against ~10% in the counter group; but this is a gap that generally persists across age groups, raising the question: how would this people describe their connection do data journalism? What's their title?

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025437"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Learning data journalism</b>

Where do data journalists pick up knowledge and skills they need for their jobs? While the overall pattern is relatively similar, in Italy more people turn to online courses, and less people to higher education and workplace training, than in the rest of the world.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025614"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

We also looked at people that, in the previous question, which was multiple choice, only picked the two answers relating to "self-taught". Overall, 30% of people are fully self-taught in data journalism. In Italy, however, this is disproportionately the case for educators and researchers, as well as retired data journalists. On the contrary, in the rest of the world it is freelancers who tend to be self-taught, to a higher degree than in Italy. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025526"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Year of experience</b>

While in the rest of the world years of experience are normally distributed around a mean of 3-5 years in the industry, in Italy people are more uniformly distributed across different year categories, with a significant dip in the 6-10 group.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025695"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Income</b>

People working in data journalism in Italy then to have their salaries concentrated in the middle of the income distribution (29% earned between 25k and 49k US dollars last year), to a higher degree than the rest of the world (although the pattern might differ significantly country to country). 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13012997"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The gender pay gap is higher in Italy than in the rest of the world (again, this will likely differ from country to country), where 95% of women earning less than 49 thousand dollar per year, against 75% of men (the percentage-point difference in the rest of the world is 3). 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025731"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


<b>Company size</b>

In Italy people tend to work in small-medium companies, or in companies with several hundreds employees, pretty much as in the rest of the world.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025792"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<br>
<h2>Skills and tools</h2>

<b>Skill level</b>

While the overall picture is fairly similar, a larger number of respondents in Italy has rated themselves "advanced" at machine learning (12% against 5% elsewhere), and fewer people state they have no experience in machine learning whatsoever (30% against 49%). A reverse trend occurs with data wrangling.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025839"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Programming languages</b>

Python is just as commonly used in Italy as HTML/CSS and SQL, showcasing a lack of hierarchy in programming languages used in Italy, as it is instead found in the rest of the world.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13032168"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<br>
<h2>Work practices</h2>

<b>Type of data journalism</b>

We borrowed on previous studies to "categorise" data journalistic outputs. These can fundamentally be organised in three groups: investigative reports that use data to uncover stories, data explainers that let the audience interact and understand datasets and statistics, and stories in which data plays a supporting and enhancing role. The latter are the most common type among the three, and this is particularly the case in Italy. On the other hand, data explainers and investigative data reports are less common in Italy, and more people felt that the answer options did not represent what they do.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025826"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Work tasks</b>

The type of work tasks performed sees at the top, both in Italy and elsewhere, data analysis (73% and 76%, respectively). Overall, the category with the biggest percentage-point difference in response was data cleaning (performed by 32% of people in Italy and 46% of people elsewhere), which also justifies why more people in Italy felt like having little to no skill in data wrangling. Looking at the opposite direction, more people in Italy tend to design web pages as part of their job roles (22% against 15%), which again matches with the higher popularity of HTML/CSS in Italy.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13026017"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Scope</b>

While the overall distribution is very similar, the biggest group of people in Italy works for outlets with an international scope (37%). National outlets comes just behind with 35%. The trend is reversed in the rest of the world, where national outlets top the geographic scope in the industry (39%) and international news come in second place (35%). Local news outlets are overall a less common workplace for data journalists in Italy (14% against 18%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026023"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Beat</b>

In terms of topic, the environment leads in Italy as the most popular area of coverage for data journalists (46%). While this is not dissimilar to respondents in other parts of the world (44%), the difference is that environmental reports are more common than stories using data to cover government and politics (here, Italy falls behind the rest of the world by 15 percentage-points). Other wide differences can be found in stories about edication (19 percentage-points), and investigative reports (23 percentage-points). Instead, lifestyle reports that use data are more common in Italy than elsewhere, although by a small margin (18% against 16%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027158"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Medium</b>

There is a clear differential trend when it comes to media: although digital outlets are the most common type of outlets for data journalists both in Italy and elsewhere, the print press in magazine and newspapers formats is a much more likely medium for people working in Italy. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027211"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Dedicated data unit</b>

Dedicated data units are much less common in Italy than elsewhere, as 14% of respondents in Italy report working in a dedicated data unit against 24% in the rest of the world. Despite this, relatively more people in Italy work in places that regularly publish data-driven projects. The top category remains an infrequent release of data-driven reports.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026033"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

For those working in data units, a minority of the sample, the size of the team tends to slightly differ between Italy and elsewhere. In Italy, medium-sized teams are more frequent, whereas in the rest of the world there is  a higher chance of working in a large or very small team.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026038"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Projects</b>

Projects tend to be delivered more quickly in Italy. Although most stories take more than a month to be published, a higher share in Italy, than elsewhere, is produced within a day (12% against 9%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027297"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Collaborations</b>

When it comes to cross-newsroom collaborations, these are not the norm in data journalism, and this is even more the case in Italy, where only 17% of respondents have partaken in a collaboration in the last year against 27% of respondents elsewhere.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026048"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<br>
<h2>Challenges and values</h2>

While the overall picture is fairly balanced, in Italy more people see discovering stories and monitoring events as key value points of the industry than in the rest of the world. Instead, less people in Italy than elsewhere consider finding the truth as a key value of data journalism (30% against 33%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026059"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

A second question about data journalism's value and contribution seems to confirm this already seen pattern that data journalism as an investigative tool matters less to respondents in Italy than elsewhere. To respondents in Italy, data journalism is rather a tool that improves multiple facets of relating to audiences: it makes outputs trustworthy, and it helps readers make sense of information.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13032538"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

When it comes to challenges, Italy is less affected by time pressure and lack of financial resources than elsewhere. Instead, data journalists in Italy seems to be relatively more concerned with data usage related issues: ensuring data is used ethically, and ensuring the data used is reliable.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027407"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<br>
<h2>Russia-Ukraine conflict coverage</h2>

In the world, just over one in five has covered the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022. In Italy, the same group is slightly smaller (16%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026089"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

However, relatively more of those who did partook in on-the-ground reporting (5% against 3%). There was also relatively more involvement in verifying sources, images, and videos (22% against 18%). On the opposite end, there was relatively less involvement in fact-checking (15% against 21%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026065"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<br>
<h2>Covid-19 pandemic</h2>

As in the rest of the world, in Italy 45% or respondents stated they became involved in data journalism as a result of the pandemic, although there is little known as to whether this is the result of a popularisation of the field or internal organisational shifts, and whether these people were already reporters before that or not.

Just as with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, slightly less people have covered the pandemic in Italy than in the rest of the world (37% against 46%). Nonetheless, these are non-negligible groups showcasing the pandemic's relative importance as a news topic in 2022.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026069"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The effects of the pandemic on workers seems to have been milder in Italy than elsewhere, with more people reporting no shift in time pressure, amount of resources, workmode, and workload. Furthermore, more people in Italy than elsewhere stated the pandemic has decreased their workload (11% against 7%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026095"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In terms of perceived effects on the industry, in Italy people tend to have positive views, with respondents believing in the pandemic having increased audience data literacy and strengthened the field. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026058"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h1 id="italian">Italiano</h1>

Per il secondo anno consecutivo, mi sono occupata di un'indagine globale rivolta al settore del data journalism, progettata e realizzata per DataJournalism.com dell'European Journalism Centre. In questo post mi baso su tale analisi per esporre le caratteristiche di un particolare sottogruppo di intervistati: coloro che lavorano come data journalists in Italia.

Le domande principali sono: quali sono le caratteristiche del settore del data journalism in Italia e come si differenziano dal resto del mondo?

I risultati dell'intera indagine sono disponibili sul <a href="https://datajournalism.com/survey/2022/">sito web dedicato</a> di Datajournalism.com, ma i grafici che seguono offrono un'immersione senza precedenti nella forza lavoro italiana dei "data journalists".

 

Ecco cosa andremo ad esplorare:

-   demografia
-   occupazione
-   competenze e strumenti
-   pratiche di lavoro
-   sfide
-   copertura russia-ucraina
-   pandemia


Oh, e un promemoria! L'analisi può essere replicata attraverso <a href="https://github.com/ejcnet/stateofdatajournalism2022">questo rilascio</a> di una versione aperta del dataset.

 
<h2>Tl;dr</h2>

In Italia, quando si parla di data journalism:

- ci sono relativamente più donne rispetto al resto del mondo, che sono anche più istruite, soprattutto rispetto ai loro colleghi maschi; le persone tendono a essere più anziane;
- ci sono relativamente più freelance e meno redattori o educatori; nessuna donna ricopre posizioni editoriali; i giovani (sotto i 24 anni) sono esclusivamente studenti, a differenza di quanto accade altrove;
- si fa meno affidamento sull’istruzione universitaria o sulla formazione sul posto di lavoro come mezzo per imparare la professione, e i corsi online colmano questa lacuna (o la creano);
- il divario retributivo tra i sessi è ancora più marcato che nel resto del mondo; ci sono meno persone che guadagnano meno, ma quando ciò accade, queste tendono a essere donne;
- c’è la tendenza a non occuparsi di giornalismo d’inchiesta come nel resto del mondo. Ci si concentra piuttosto sul web design, sull’uso di linguaggi come HTML/CSS e sulla creazione di storie arricchite da dati. Questa mancanza di priorità del giornalismo investigativo rispetto al resto del mondo si ripropone quando si esaminano i valori percepiti e le sfide del giornalismo dei dati;
- le persone del settore sono state relativamente meno colpite personalmente dalla pandemia, che viene vista come avente un effetto per lo più positivo sul giornalismo dei dati; quasi la metà degli intervistati è diventata giornalista dei dati a seguito della pandemia;
- le difficoltà del settore, rispetto al resto del mondo, sono relativamente più incentrate sull’uso corretto dei dati piuttosto che sulle limitazioni finanziarie o sulla pressione del tempo;
- il maggior numero di persone tende a occuparsi di ambiente, mentre altrove la categoria principale è la politica. Le persone che lavorano per le testate internazionali sono relativamente (e anche in termini assoluti) più numerose di quelle nazionali. La stampa, in formato giornale o rivista, è molto più diffusa come mezzo di pubblicazione rispetto al resto del mondo, anche se in generale prevalgono i mezzi digitali;
- ci sono relativamente meno collaborazioni, meno unità di dati dedicate, e relativamente più storie sono state consegnate entro un giorno, nonostante le scadenze più lunghe siano la norma anche in Italia;
- un numero relativamente maggiore di reporter ha realizzato una copertura sul campo del conflitto tra Ucraina e Russia rispetto al resto del mondo.


<br>
<h2>Dati demografici</h2>

Più donne della media e in generale più anziane: è questo il quadro che emerge dai dati demografici italiani dell'indagine The State of Data Journalism Survey 2022.

L'andamento dell'età tra gli italiani e il resto del mondo è sensibilmente diverso: mentre nel mondo il 38% ha più di 45 anni, in Italia la stessa fascia è del 58%.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13012778"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Per quanto riguarda l'istruzione, le donne tendono a essere più istruite degli uomini, e questo è un dato che si riscontra sia in Italia che nel resto del mondo. Inoltre, gli italiani che si occupano di data journalism tendono ad avere un livello di istruzione più elevato rispetto a quelli di tutto il mondo, con un numero maggiore di persone che hanno conseguito un master. Tuttavia, quando si tratta di dottorati di ricerca, il quadro è leggermente diverso: mentre il 14% delle donne in Italia ha un dottorato di ricerca, solo il 5% degli uomini lo ha. Questo contro l'11% e il 12% nel resto del mondo, evidenziando così un divario che non si riscontra nel resto del mondo.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13013014"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In termini di disciplina, i data journalist in Italia hanno meno probabilità di conseguire lauree in discipline umanistiche rispetto alle loro controparti (54% contro 42%), e hanno invece maggiori probabilità di conseguire lauree in scienze sociali, formali e naturali, oltre che in aree non coperte dall'elenco delle opzioni.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


<br>
<h2>Occupazione</h2>

<b>L'occupazione</b>

L'Italia è un Paese di liberi professionisti. Mentre nel resto del mondo le prime due occupazioni nel data journalism sono quelle a tempo pieno presso un'organizzazione giornalistica (31%) e quelle basate sulla ricerca/istruzione (15%), in Italia i freelance rappresentano il 35% di tutti i tipi di occupazione (contro il 22% nel resto del mondo).In Italia, tuttavia, ci sono meno persone che ricoprono posizioni editoriali o lavori nel campo della ricerca e dell'istruzione.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025227"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Per genere, capiamo un po' di più di queste discrepanze. Ricordate tutti i freelance che ci sono in Italia? Ebbene, i freelance a tempo pieno tendono a essere uomini, mentre i freelance part-time tendono a essere donne. Inoltre, praticamente nessuna donna in Italia che abbia partecipato al sondaggio ricopre una posizione editoriale nel data journalism. Gli uomini sono sovrarappresentati anche nelle posizioni di ricerca/educazione (5% degli uomini contro il 3% delle donne). Una quota maggiore di studenti in Italia tende a essere costituita da donne (10% delle donne, contro il 6% degli uomini).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025376"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<br>


E l'età? Quando i lavoratori assumono ruoli diversi? Gli schemi sono molto diversi tra l'Italia e il resto del mondo. Prima di tutto, se avete meno di 24 anni in Italia siete molto probabilmente (al 100% nel nostro set di dati) studenti. Questo non è proprio il caso altrove, dato che solo il 39% degli under 24 nel resto del mondo sono studenti. Un'altra differenza evidente è che le posizioni di ricerca altrove aumentano linearmente con l'età, mentre in Italia sono disperse tra le varie fasce d'età. Al contrario, mentre nel mondo i ruoli editoriali sono distribuiti uniformemente tra le età, in Italia sono un privilegio per i più anziani. Mentre i contratti di lavoro tendono a essere più comuni tra i giovani di età compresa tra i 18 e i 44 anni, in Italia sono ancora una volta sparsi tra le varie fasce d'età. Infine, una differenza significativa riguarda il numero di persone che hanno ritenuto che le opzioni di risposta non li rappresentassero: quasi il 40% nella fascia d'età 45-54 anni in Italia, contro il ~10% nel gruppo del contatore; ma questo è un divario che persiste in generale tra le fasce d'età, sollevando la domanda: come descriverebbero queste persone il loro legame con il data journalism? Qual è il loro titolo?

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025437"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Imparare il giornalismo dei dati</b>

Dove i giornalisti dei dati acquisiscono le conoscenze e le competenze necessarie per il loro lavoro? Sebbene l'andamento generale sia relativamente simile, in Italia ci si rivolge maggiormente ai corsi online e meno all'istruzione superiore e alla formazione sul posto di lavoro rispetto al resto del mondo.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025614"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Abbiamo anche esaminato le persone che, nella domanda precedente, che era a scelta multipla, hanno scelto solo le due risposte relative all'"autodidatta". Complessivamente, il 30% delle persone è completamente autodidatta nel data journalism. In Italia, tuttavia, ciò avviene in misura sproporzionata per gli educatori e i ricercatori, nonché per i data journalist in pensione. Al contrario, nel resto del mondo sono i freelance che tendono a essere autodidatti, in misura maggiore che in Italia.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025526"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


<b>Anni di esperienza</b>

Mentre nel resto del mondo gli anni di esperienza sono normalmente distribuiti intorno a una media di 3-5 anni nel settore, in Italia le persone sono distribuite in modo più uniforme tra le diverse categorie di anni, con una significativa flessione nel gruppo 6-10.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025695"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Reddito</b>

Le persone che lavorano nel data journalism in Italia hanno poi uno stipendio concentrato nella parte centrale della distribuzione del reddito (il 29% ha guadagnato tra i 25k e i 49k dollari l'anno scorso), in misura maggiore rispetto al resto del mondo (anche se l'andamento potrebbe variare significativamente da Paese a Paese). 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13012997"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Il divario retributivo tra i sessi è più alto in Italia che nel resto del mondo (anche in questo caso, il dato può variare da Paese a Paese), dove il 95% delle donne guadagna meno di 49 mila dollari all'anno, contro il 75% degli uomini (la differenza in punti percentuali nel resto del mondo è di 3). 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025731"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Dimensione aziendale</b>

In Italia si tende a lavorare in aziende medio-piccole o con alcune centinaia di dipendenti, più o meno come nel resto del mondo.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13025792"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Competenze e strumenti</h2>

<b>Livello di competenza</b>

Sebbene il quadro generale sia abbastanza simile, un numero maggiore di intervistati in Italia si è classificato come "avanzato" nell'apprendimento automatico (12% contro il 5% altrove), e meno persone dichiarano di non avere alcuna esperienza nell'apprendimento automatico (30% contro 49%). Una tendenza inversa si verifica con il data wrangling.

<b>Linguaggi di programmazione</b>

Python è utilizzato in Italia tanto quanto HTML/CSS e SQL, evidenziando una mancanza di gerarchia nei linguaggi di programmazione utilizzati in Italia, come invece si riscontra nel resto del mondo.

<h2>Pratiche lavorative</h2>

<b>Tipo di giornalismo dei dati</b>

Abbiamo preso spunto da studi precedenti per "categorizzare" i dati giornalistici. Questi possono essere organizzati fondamentalmente in tre gruppi: reportage investigativi che utilizzano i dati per scoprire storie, spiegazioni di dati che permettono al pubblico di interagire e comprendere insiemi di dati e statistiche, e storie in cui i dati svolgono un ruolo di supporto e valorizzazione. Questi ultimi sono la tipologia più comune tra le tre, in particolare in Italia. D'altra parte, i data explainers e i rapporti investigativi sui dati sono meno comuni in Italia, e un numero maggiore di persone ha ritenuto che le opzioni di risposta non rappresentassero ciò che fanno.

<b>Mansioni lavorative</b>

Il tipo di mansioni lavorative svolte vede al primo posto, sia in Italia che altrove, l'analisi dei dati (73% e 76%, rispettivamente). Complessivamente, la categoria con la maggiore differenza di punti percentuali nelle risposte è stata la pulizia dei dati (svolta dal 32% delle persone in Italia e dal 46% delle persone altrove), il che giustifica anche il motivo per cui un maggior numero di persone in Italia ha ritenuto di avere poche o nessuna competenza nel data wrangling. Se si guarda alla direzione opposta, più persone in Italia tendono a progettare pagine web come parte del loro ruolo lavorativo (22% contro 15%), il che corrisponde ancora una volta alla maggiore popolarità di HTML/CSS in Italia.

<b>Ambito di applicazione</b>

Sebbene la distribuzione complessiva sia molto simile, il gruppo più numeroso di persone in Italia lavora per outlet di portata internazionale (37%). Gli outlet nazionali sono appena dietro con il 35%. La tendenza si inverte nel resto del mondo, dove gli outlet nazionali sono al primo posto per portata geografica nel settore (39%) e le notizie internazionali sono al secondo posto (35%). Le redazioni locali sono nel complesso un luogo di lavoro meno comune per i data journalist in Italia (14% contro 18%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026023"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Topic</b>

In termini di argomento, l'ambiente è in testa in Italia come area di copertura più popolare per i data journalist (46%). Sebbene questo dato non sia dissimile da quello degli intervistati in altre parti del mondo (44%), la differenza è che i reportage ambientali sono più comuni delle storie che utilizzano i dati per coprire il governo e la politica (in questo caso, l'Italia è indietro rispetto al resto del mondo di 15 punti percentuali). Altre ampie differenze si riscontrano nelle storie di edicazione (19 punti percentuali) e nei reportage investigativi (23 punti percentuali). I reportage di lifestyle che utilizzano i dati sono invece più comuni in Italia che altrove, anche se di poco (18% contro 16%).

<b>Media</b>

Esiste una chiara tendenza differenziale per quanto riguarda i media: sebbene i punti vendita digitali siano il tipo di sbocco più comune per i giornalisti di dati sia in Italia che altrove, la stampa nei formati di riviste e quotidiani è un mezzo molto più probabile per chi lavora in Italia. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027211"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


<b>Unità dati dedicata</b>

Le unità dati dedicate sono molto meno comuni in Italia che altrove: il 14% degli intervistati in Italia riferisce di lavorare in un'unità dati dedicata, contro il 24% nel resto del mondo. Ciononostante, un numero relativamente maggiore di persone in Italia lavora in luoghi che pubblicano regolarmente progetti basati sui dati. La categoria principale rimane la pubblicazione non frequente di rapporti basati sui dati.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026033"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Per coloro che lavorano in unità dati, una minoranza del campione, le dimensioni del team tendono a differire leggermente tra l'Italia e il resto del mondo. In Italia sono più frequenti i team di medie dimensioni, mentre nel resto del mondo è più probabile lavorare in un team grande o molto piccolo.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026038"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<b>Progetti</b>

I progetti tendono a essere consegnati più rapidamente in Italia. Sebbene la maggior parte delle storie richieda più di un mese per essere pubblicata, una quota maggiore in Italia, rispetto al resto del mondo, viene prodotta entro un giorno (12% contro 9%).

<b>Collaborazioni</b>

Quando si parla di collaborazioni tra redazioni, queste non sono la norma nel giornalismo dei dati, e questo è ancora più vero in Italia, dove solo il 17% degli intervistati ha partecipato a una collaborazione nell'ultimo anno contro il 27% degli intervistati altrove.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026048"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Sfide e valori</h2>

Sebbene il quadro generale sia abbastanza equilibrato, in Italia più persone considerano la scoperta di storie e il monitoraggio di eventi come punti di valore chiave del settore rispetto al resto del mondo. Invece, meno persone in Italia che altrove considerano la ricerca della verità come un valore chiave del data journalism (30% contro 33%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026059"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Una seconda domanda sul valore e sul contributo del data journalism sembra confermare il modello già visto, secondo cui il data journalism come strumento di indagine conta meno per gli intervistati in Italia che altrove. Per gli intervistati in Italia, il data journalism è piuttosto uno strumento che migliora molteplici aspetti del rapporto con il pubblico: rende gli output affidabili e aiuta i lettori a dare un senso alle informazioni.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/13027407"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Per quanto riguarda le sfide, l'Italia è meno colpita dalla pressione del tempo e dalla mancanza di risorse finanziarie rispetto ad altri Paesi. Invece, i giornalisti che si occupano di dati in Italia sembrano essere relativamente più preoccupati delle questioni legate all'utilizzo dei dati: assicurarsi che i dati siano utilizzati in modo etico e che i dati utilizzati siano affidabili.

<h2>Copertura del conflitto Russia-Ucraina</h2>

Nel mondo, poco più di uno su cinque ha coperto il conflitto Russia-Ucraina nel 2022. In Italia, lo stesso gruppo è leggermente inferiore (16%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026089"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Tuttavia, un numero relativamente maggiore di coloro che lo hanno fatto ha partecipato a reportage sul campo (5% contro 3%). Anche la verifica delle fonti, delle immagini e dei video è stata relativamente più intensa (22% contro 18%). All'opposto, il coinvolgimento nel fact-checking è stato relativamente minore (15% contro 21%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026065"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>



<br>
<h2>Pandemia di Covid-19</h2>

Come nel resto del mondo, anche in Italia il 45% degli intervistati ha dichiarato di essersi occupato di data journalism a seguito della pandemia, anche se non si sa se questo sia il risultato di una divulgazione del settore o di cambiamenti organizzativi interni, e se queste persone fossero già reporter prima o meno.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026068"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Come nel caso del conflitto tra Russia e Ucraina, anche in Italia il numero di persone che si sono occupate della pandemia è leggermente inferiore rispetto al resto del mondo (37% contro 46%). Tuttavia, si tratta di gruppi non trascurabili che evidenziano l'importanza relativa della pandemia come argomento di cronaca nel 2022.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026069"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Gli effetti della pandemia sui lavoratori sembrano essere stati più lievi in Italia rispetto al resto del mondo, con un numero maggiore di persone che non ha segnalato alcun cambiamento in termini di pressione temporale, quantità di risorse, modalità di lavoro e carico di lavoro. Inoltre, più persone in Italia che altrove hanno dichiarato che la pandemia ha diminuito il loro carico di lavoro (11% contro 7%).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13026095"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In termini di effetti percepiti sul settore, in Italia si tende ad avere una visione positiva: gli intervistati ritengono che la pandemia abbia aumentato l'alfabetizzazione dei dati del pubblico e rafforzato il settore.
